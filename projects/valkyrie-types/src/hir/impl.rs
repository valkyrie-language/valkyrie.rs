///
/// Impl blocks can have generic parameters, which is essential for implementing
/// traits for generic types:
///
/// ```v
/// impl<T: Clone> Clone for Box<T> {
///     micro clone(self) -> Self {
///         Box { value: self.value.clone() }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Associated Type Implementations
///
/// When implementing a trait with associated types, the impl block must specify
/// concrete types for each associated type:
///
/// ```v
/// impl Iterator for Counter {
///     type Item = i32
///
///     micro next(self) -> Self::Item? {
///         // implementation
///     }
/// }
/// ```

/// Represents a derive macro invocation in HIR.
///
/// Derive macros automatically implement traits for types based on their structure.
/// When a type is annotated with `@derive(Trait1, Trait2)`, the compiler generates
/// appropriate trait implementations during compilation.
///
/// # Supported Derive Traits
///
/// Common derive traits include:
/// - `Eq` - Equality comparison
/// - `Hash` - Hashing for use in hash maps
/// - `Show` - String representation for debugging
/// - `Clone` - Explicit cloning capability
/// - `Default` - Default value construction
/// - `Serialize` / `Deserialize` - Serialization support
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```v
/// @derive(Hash, Eq, Show)
/// structure Point {
///     x: i32
///     y: i32
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The derive macro system will generate implementations equivalent to:
///
/// ```v
/// impl Hash for Point {
///     micro hash(self) -> u64 { ... }
/// }
/// impl Eq for Point {
///     micro eq(self, other: Self) -> bool { ... }
/// }
/// impl Show for Point {
///     micro show(self) -> String { ... }
/// }
/// ```
